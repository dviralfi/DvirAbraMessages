A simple rest API backend system that is responsible for handling
messages between users.

A message contains :
1. sender (owner)

3. Message
4. Subject
5. creation date


The rest API should contains :
- Write message
- Get all messages for a specific user
- Get all unread messages for a specific user
- Read message (return one message)
- Delete message (as owner or as receiver)
